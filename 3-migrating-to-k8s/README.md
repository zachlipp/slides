# Migrating a machine learning pipeline to Kubernetes

Date: 19 February 2020

An overview of some of my work at Lumere presented as a lightning talk at ChiPy's Python Powered Healthcare night. From the [event description](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/events/267264866/):
> Lumere uses Python for everything from serving our application to powering our data science and data engineering teams. In this talk, we'll discuss how Lumere uses machine learning models developed in Python to classify hospital purchases, how we've deployed those models, and what we've learned porting this deployment to Kubernetes.
